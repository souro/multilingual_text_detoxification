# Text Detoxification

This repo contains the code and data of the paper: [Text Detoxification as Style Transfer in English and Hindi](https://aclanthology.org/2023.icon-1.13/)

## Overview
This repository focuses on text detoxification, which involves automatically transforming toxic text into nontoxic text, contributing to safer online communication. We frame this task as a Text Style Transfer (TST) problem, where the style changes, but the content remains intact. Our research presents three approaches: (i) knowledge transfer from related tasks, (ii) a multi-task learning approach that integrates sequence-to-sequence modeling with various toxicity classification tasks, and (iii) a delete-and-reconstruct method. We utilize a dataset from Dementieva et al. (2021), which includes multiple detoxified versions of toxic texts. Our experiments, guided by expert human annotators, create a dataset where each toxic sentence is paired with an appropriate detoxified version. Additionally, we introduce a small Hindi parallel dataset aligned with part of the English dataset for evaluation. Our results show that our methods effectively detoxify text while preserving its content and fluency.
